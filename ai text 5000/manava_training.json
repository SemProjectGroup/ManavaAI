When youth are active participants of the democratic system, the political scene becomes fairer, livelier, and more attuned to the needs of the society. Youth-led protests and voter mobilization in countries like India and South Korea have been instrumental in shaping elections and policy reforms, which is a clear demonstration of the effect of active citizenship in the real world."

Together with these technological trends, they shape not only our living but also our thinking habits and even the way we interact with others.

The global market has become the working stage for enterprises that are fueled by the power of worldwide communication, which takes place in a blink of an eye, and is supported by the presence of information anywhere you are just by the tap of the screen. Thus, technology has fostered some people to live a life of ease, effective time management, and of having endless possibilities that the generations before them could only dream of.

Internet, gadgets, and various online services have become their window to the world, giving them the opportunity to get familiar with worldwide ideas, political debates, and social movements. Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram are the media not only for political talks but also for protest organization and awareness campaigns.

They are becoming less and less accepting of slow governance and more likely to call for reforms and accountability. Their voices have been raised through grassroots movements, web campaigns, and youth-led NGOs. Issues like environmental protection, gender equality, climate change, digital rights, and education reform are very close to them.

While old politicians opt for hierarchical structures, negotiation, and party loyalty, Gen Z on the other hand looks for meritocracy, digital engagement, and immediate responsiveness. Social networking campaigns, online petitions, and public discussions are ways by which traditional politicians are challenged, and these activities sometimes irritate them because they are not used to these methods of communication, but at the same time, this provokes the government to move towards modernization."

The movements show that Gen Z digs the root of the systemic problems and that they are ready to engage in them openly and force the government to provide a solution.

The only way to close this gap is through conversation, making policies that are for and by the people, and allowing young people to take part in the decision-making processes.
